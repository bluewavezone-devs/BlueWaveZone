          <p className="mb-4">
            By "business partners" we mean any individual or organization Blue Wave Zone deals with during planning or doing business, 
            anywhere in the world.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Trade compliance refers to the actual business transactions and involves following regulations regarding sanctions, 
            anti-bribery and corruption, tax evasion and money laundering, human rights, and the environment, among other things. 
            Sanctions are restrictions put in place and enforced mainly by the US, the EU and the UN. Some sanctions prohibit 
            doing business with specific countries, while some prohibit doing business with certain persons or certain products. 
            Business should not be conducted with any sanctioned party, including re-selling or diverting products to sanctioned 
            parties or territories.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-[var(--color-brown)] mb-4">5. Bribery and corruption</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            To offer a bribe means offering something of value to a business partner, with the condition of doing business.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            To receive a bribe means receiving something of value from a business partner, with the expectation of a benefit in return.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            'Something of value' could include money, gifts, loans, fees, hospitality, services, discounts, the award of a contract or anything else of value.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            To bribe a foreign official means paying an individual in his/her capacity as an official. Common bribes come in the form of additional "facilitation" payments to foreign officials to speed up an administrative process.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            It is a criminal offence to offer, promise, give, request or accept a bribe.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Corruption is the abuse of entrusted power or position for personal gain.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Blue Wave Zone is committed to, and requires its Business Partners to, comply with national and international 
            anti-bribery and corruptions laws around the world, including but not limited to, the Foreign Corrupt Practices 
            Act of 1977 ("FCPA") and the "UK Bribery Act 2010". These laws can apply to acts wherever in the world they 
            take place and irrespective of local standards or cultural norms.
